# Horizon-Beyond

Welcome to **Horizon-Beyond**, a Python pip library that gives a Gen Z twist to popular libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, pandas, and more by renaming their functions and modules to more trendy and modern terms. This unique library brings a touch of fun to coding while retaining the functionality of the original libraries.

---

## Installation

Install Horizon-Beyond using pip:

```bash
pip install horizon-beyond
```

---
Sure, hereâ€™s the updated README with the specified functions included in the **Quick Start** and **Renamed Libraries** sections.

---

## Quick Start

```python
import horizon_beyond as hb

# Original import
import numpy as np

# Gen Z-styled import
import horizon_beyond.numpy as genz_np

# Using original NumPy
original_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Using Gen Z-styled NumPy
trendy_array = genz_np.matrix([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print("Original:", original_array)
print("Trendy:", trendy_array)
```

## Usage

To make the most of Horizon-Beyond, you can rename and use multiple libraries simultaneously in a Gen Z style:

```python
import horizon_beyond.tensorflow as tf_vibes
import horizon_beyond.numpy as np_vibes

# Use renamed functions
data = np_vibes.matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
const_vibe = tf_vibes.anchor(3.0)

print("Data Matrix:", data)
print("Constant Value:", const_vibe)
```
